## Requirements

- PHP

## Instalation

Simply copy the project files to a webserver with php. There is no set up. All data will be saved under the server folder.

## Why?

I ran into a scenario where a group of people needed to figure out a day when everyone was available. Because everyone had different schedules it was difficult to keep up with everyone's availability. The best solution was to set up a calendar that everyone had access to and to cross off days people were not available, leaving only the days that everyone could make work.
